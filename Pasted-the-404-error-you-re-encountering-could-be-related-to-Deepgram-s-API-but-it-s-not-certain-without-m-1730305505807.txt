the 404 error you're encountering could be related to Deepgram's API, but it's not certain without more context. Here's what we can infer:
HTTP 404 Error: This is a standard "Not Found" error, indicating that the server couldn't find the requested resource.
Deepgram API: The search results mention Deepgram's API reference for errors, which suggests you might be working with or attempting to access Deepgram's services.
However, a 404 error can occur for various reasons, not necessarily specific to Deepgram. Here are some possibilities and steps to troubleshoot:
Check the URL:
Ensure you're using the correct endpoint URL for the Deepgram API.
Verify that there are no typos in the URL.
API Version:
Make sure you're using the correct version of the API in your request.
Authentication:
Verify that you're including the correct API key or authentication token in your request.
Resource Existence:
If you're trying to access a specific resource (like a particular transcription job), ensure that it actually exists.
Deepgram Service Status:
Check Deepgram's status page or developer portal for any known issues or outages.
Request Method:
Confirm you're using the correct HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) for the endpoint you're trying to access.
Permissions:
Ensure your Deepgram account has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource.
API Documentation:
Review Deepgram's API documentation to confirm you're following their guidelines correctly.
If you've verified all these points and are still encountering the 404 error, it would be advisable to:
Double-check the exact API call you're making.
Review any error messages or response bodies for more detailed information.
Contact Deepgram's support team with the specific details of your request and the error you're receiving.
Remember, without seeing the exact API call you're making or more details about your implementation, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact cause of the 404 error. If you can provide more specifics about your request, I might be able to offer more targeted advice.
