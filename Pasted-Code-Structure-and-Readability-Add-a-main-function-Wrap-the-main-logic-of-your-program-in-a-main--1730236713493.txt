Code Structure and Readability
Add a main function:
Wrap the main logic of your program in a main() function. This is a good practice for organizing your code and making it more modular.
Use consistent indentation:
Ensure all your code is properly indented. This is crucial in Python as it affects the program's structure and readability.
Add comments:
Include comments to explain the purpose of different sections of your code. This will make it easier for others (and yourself) to understand the code later.
Input Validation
Validate user input:
Add error handling for invalid inputs. For example, check if the user enters a number when asked for their age.
Game Logic
Implement a scoring system:
Keep track of the player's score throughout the game. This will make the game more engaging and give the player a sense of progress.
Add more variety to questions:
Expand the range of questions to make the game more interesting and challenging.
Randomize question order:
Shuffle the questions each time the game is played to add unpredictability.
Here's an example of how you could implement some of these improvements:
python
import random

def ask_question(question, correct_answer):
    print(question)
    user_answer = input("Your answer: ").strip().lower()
    return user_answer == correct_answer.lower()

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Python Quiz Game!")
    
    try:
        age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number for your age.")
        return

    name = input("Please enter your name: ")
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Let's start the quiz.")

    questions = [
        ("What is the capital of France?", "Paris"),
        ("What is 2 + 2?", "4"),
        ("What is the largest planet in our solar system?", "Jupiter"),
        # Add more questions here
    ]

    random.shuffle(questions)
    score = 0

    for question, answer in questions:
        if ask_question(question, answer):
            print("Correct!")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Sorry, the correct answer was {answer}.")

    print(f"\nQuiz completed! Your score: {score}/{len(questions)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

This improved version includes a main function, better structure, input validation, a scoring system, and the potential for more varied questions. Remember to expand the question list to make the game more comprehensive and engaging.
